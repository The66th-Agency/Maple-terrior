## Project Overview
Premium editorial + headless e-commerce website for Maple Terroir — a third-generation, family-owned Canadian maple syrup company based in Quebec's Appalachian Mountains. The site combines storytelling with a fully shoppable catalog powered by Shopify's Storefront API. Deployed to Cloudflare Pages (auto-deploys on push to main).

## Tech Stack
- **HTML/CSS/JS** — all-in-one single-file pages (no build step, no bundler, no framework)
- **Tailwind CSS** via CDN (`cdn.tailwindcss.com`)
- **Shopify Storefront API** — headless e-commerce (cart, checkout, products, collections, blog)
- **PostHog** — analytics (loaded via `assets/shared.js`)
- **Fonts**: Fraunces (variable serif headings, optical sizing) + Plus Jakarta Sans (body)
- **Color palette**: cream `#FDFBF7`, amber-warm `#C4841D`, charcoal `#1A1714`, warm-gray scale
- **Animations**: IntersectionObserver scroll reveals, requestAnimationFrame video scrubbing, CSS marquees
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages, GitHub repo at The66th-Agency/Maple-terrior

## Development
No build step. Open any HTML file in a browser to preview. For local development with live reload, use any static file server (e.g., `npx serve` or VS Code Live Server extension).

## Shopify Storefront API
- **Endpoint**: `https://maple-terroir.myshopify.com/api/2026-01/graphql.json`
- **Public token**: in `assets/shared.js` and inline in each page's `<script>` block
- **Cart persistence**: `localStorage` key `maple_cart_id`
- Dynamic pages (`product.html`, `collection.html`, `blog/post.html`) load data via URL params (`?handle=xxx`)

## Architecture

### Shared infrastructure (`assets/shared.js`)
Loaded by every page. Provides: announcement bar, search modal (Ctrl+K), back-to-top button, recently viewed tracking, cart drawer (slide-out with qty controls, Shopify mutations). Each page also has its own inline `<script>` with page-specific Shopify API calls and cart logic.

### Page types
| Type | Files | Data source |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Static editorial | `index.html`, `story.html`, `terroir.html`, `certifications.html` | Hardcoded HTML |
| Static catalog | `products.html` | Hardcoded product cards with Shopify variant IDs |
| Dynamic product | `product.html?handle=xxx` | Shopify Storefront API (single product query) |
| Dynamic collection | `collection.html?handle=xxx` | Shopify Storefront API (collection query) |
| SEO collection | `collections/*.html` (9 pages) | Hardcoded hero + Shopify API for product grid |
| Dynamic blog | `blog/index.html`, `blog/post.html?handle=xxx&blog=yyy` | Shopify Storefront API (articles query) |
| Utility | `404.html`, `sitemap.xml` | Static |

### index.html section order
1. Hero — asymmetric editorial split with video
2. Retailer Logos — "Where to Find Us" trust strip (marquee)
3. Products — bento-style asymmetric grid linking to collection pages
4. Our Story — heritage, family narrative (static)
5. Testimonials — social proof marquee
6. Scroll Sequence — locomotive frame-by-frame animation
7. Terroir — single-origin story editorial split
8. Certifications — trust and credibility (dark section)
9. Global Reach — markets served
10. CTA Banner — final conversion push
11. Footer

## Key Patterns

### Cart + Add to Cart
Every page includes inline Shopify cart logic (createCart, addToCart, updateCart mutations). Product cards use `event.stopPropagation()` on the Add to Cart button so card click → detail page, button click → quick add.

### Scroll reveals
Elements with class `.reveal` use IntersectionObserver to animate in. Must include `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` fallback (opacity: 1, no transform) on every page.

### Nav + mobile menu
Navigation is duplicated inline in every HTML file (no templating). When modifying nav links, update all pages: `index.html`, `story.html`, `terroir.html`, `certifications.html`, `products.html`, `product.html`, `collection.html`, `404.html`, `blog/index.html`, `blog/post.html`, and all 9 `collections/*.html` files.

### Subdirectory path handling
Pages in `blog/` and `collections/` use `../` relative paths. `shared.js` detects subdirectory via `window.location.pathname` and adjusts link prefixes.

## Design Constraints
- **Accessibility**: All pages must include `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` support
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **No emoji entities**: Use inline SVG icons instead of HTML emoji entities (&#xxx;)
- **Accent color**: Amber only (`#C4841D` / `#F4C77D`) — no emerald, blue, or rose accents
- **Border radius**: 2rem on cards
- **No stock images**: Product images come from Shopify CDN (`cdn.shopify.com`)
- **Consistent headers**: Use the eyebrow → H2 pattern across all sections (user rejected variety)
- **Consistent section width**: All sections must use `max-w-[1400px] mx-auto px-4 md:px-8`. No section should break out of this container or use full-viewport width.

## Deployment & Environments
**Always commit and push to `main` after completing changes.** This project auto-deploys via Cloudflare Pages on push to `main` (GitHub repo `The66th-Agency/Maple-terrior`). Don't wait for the user to ask - if the work is done, push it.

### Which URL is what (CRITICAL — verify before any QA)
- **`https://maple-terrior-new.liamlytton99.workers.dev/`** — the Cloudflare Workers preview of THIS repo. This is the canonical preview Liam and Shawn review against. When the client says "the site" or "pull up the site," default to this URL.
- **`https://mapleterroir.com/`** — legacy public Shopify storefront. Different design, different copy, different product ordering. Do NOT treat as source of truth for the rebuild. Only reference when explicitly asked about what is currently live on Shopify.
- Never tell the client "I'm working on the right site" without first confirming which URL they are looking at.

## Lab Notes
[date] [what happened] [what to do differently]

2026-03-29 — [SUPERSEDED by 2026-04-15 entry below] Originally logged a "never switch to Workers" rule. That turned out to be stale. The Workers URL `maple-terrior-new.liamlytton99.workers.dev` IS the canonical preview the client reviews against.

2026-03-30 — When making bento grid changes (copy, subtext, contrast), apply changes uniformly across ALL cards. Proposed removing body copy from some cards but keeping it on others (syrup + chocolates) based on a judgment call - resulted in an inconsistent grid that looked worse than either all-in or all-out. Had to do a second commit to fix it. **Rule: Bento grids are a system. Any copy or style change must be applied consistently to every card. Never half-apply - pick a direction and commit to all cards at once.**

2026-03-31 — Multiple issues from processing Shawn's multi-email feedback batch:
1. Cherry chocolate images were shown in the conversation at the start but kept getting flagged as "never received" in email drafts. **Rule: When processing multi-email client feedback, inventory ALL requests and assets upfront before executing anything. Never claim something is missing without checking the conversation first.**
2. Blueberry box photo was uploaded to "Blueberry Ceylon Tea" instead of "Dark Chocolate Covered Blueberry" due to similar names. **Rule: Always use exact full Shopify product titles when giving upload instructions. Never use shorthand.**
3. object-contain CSS fix looked great on tall box products but broke wide bag products, had to revert. **Rule: Before deploying any CSS change, mentally test it against ALL product types on the page, not just the target.**
4. Syrup collection was reordered in Shopify but products.html had its own JS sort (SYRUP_ORDER) overriding Shopify's manual order. Wasted time in Shopify before finding the code override. **Rule: Always check if the codebase has client-side sort/filter logic before sending the user into Shopify to fix ordering.**

2026-04-15 — Full session log. Shawn sent red-markup screenshots with FAQ edits, product reorder asks, stat corrections, photo swaps, and a stroopwafel title-wrap complaint. All shipped, but several unforced errors along the way.

### Mistakes and rules

1. **Pulled up mapleterroir.com (legacy Shopify) when Liam said "pull up the MT website."** Wasted his time. Then cited a stale 2026-03-29 lab note ("never use Workers") to argue when he pushed back, instead of verifying against reality. **Rule: Before any MT QA, content, or "check the site" task, default to `maple-terrior-new.liamlytton99.workers.dev`. Never cite a lab note against observed evidence — verify first, update the note second.** The Workers URL vs Shopify URL distinction is now in the Deployment & Environments section above; re-read it any time the client says "the site."

2. **Claimed all 5 stroopwafel titles rendered on 2 lines when Pure Maple Syrup Stroopwafels was actually on 1 line of text inside a 2-line-padded box.** Was measuring `boundingBox.height / lineHeight`, which is fooled by `min-height` + `line-clamp`. Shawn was right; I told Liam he was wrong; had to eat it. **Rule: When asked "does this text wrap to N lines," measure via `Range.getClientRects()` and count distinct `top` values. Bounding-box math lies whenever `min-height`, padding, `line-clamp`, or `-webkit-box` is involved.**

3. **Shipped a hardcoded `<br>` for Pure Maple that fixed mid-width but broke wide viewports** — others went to 1 line while Pure Maple stayed 2 lines, the inverse of the original bug. Didn't test at multiple widths before pushing. **Rule: Any fix to product-card title wrapping, grid alignment, bento copy, or any layout symptom caused by mixed line counts must be tested at a minimum of 3 viewport widths (narrow ~400px, mid ~1280px, wide ~1920px) before commit. Per-item overrides almost always create the inverse bug somewhere else — prefer dynamic equalizers (post-render JS measuring actual line counts per grid).**

4. **Summarised only part of the session when Liam asked for a recap.** Gave him the 4 latest edits and left out the FAQ work from earlier in the same session. He had to chase me for it. **Rule: When the user asks for "what did we do" or "summary," recap the entire session, not just the most recent batch. When unsure of scope, check `git log` for every commit since the session started and list each.**

### Patterns and infrastructure we built this session

- **Dynamic title equalizer** — in [products.html](products.html) and [collections/stroopwafels.html](collections/stroopwafels.html). Post-render JS per grid: measure each title via `Range.getClientRects()`; if any wraps to 2+ lines, split every title before its last word with `<br>`; if all fit on 1 line, collapse `min-height` to 0. Re-runs on window resize (debounced 150ms). Reuse this pattern for any grid where mixed title lengths cause uneven card heights.
- **Cookie sort order** — `COOKIE_ORDER` + `cookieSortKey` in [products.html](products.html), same pattern as `SYRUP_ORDER` (client-side sort overrides Shopify's manual collection order). If Shawn reorders the cookies collection in Shopify and nothing moves, this is why.
- **Markets grid is 3-col on md+** — [certifications.html](certifications.html). Was 2-col; upgraded to fit CA/JP/KR/CN/US/TW. Touching this grid means accounting for 6+ cards, not 4.

### Copy and content facts locked in

- **"Our Promise" stats on [terroir.html](terroir.html):** 3rd Generation Farm (not 4th), 3x Certified (not "4x Organic Certified"). Only the SYRUP is organic-certified, not the full product line — so claims like "4x organic certified" across the whole company are wrong. The 3 certs are Ecocert, Canada Organic, USDA Organic.
- **FAQ source of truth is [index.html](index.html) homepage only** — no standalone FAQ page. Currently 12 Qs: 7 original (Shawn-edited) + 5 new (international shipping, storage, grades, organic cert, wholesale). When Shawn asks to "add more FAQs," append here.
- **Markets list (CA/JP/KR/CN/US/TW)** is framed as "markets served" on the certifications page — that context is fine to list countries in. This is different from the global rule "don't list specific shipping countries in FAQ/shipping claims" (import regs vary). The distinction: market presence vs shipping offering.
- **No contractions rule** still holds for all user-facing MT copy. Drafted new FAQ entries this session follow this.

### Asset handling

- **Photo swaps from the legacy Shopify site** — the current `mapleterroir.com` is built on Instant.so and its CDN is `cdn.instant.so/sites/Kjn4vpPuFvAsOEBs/assets/...`. When the client references "the photo on the current site," find it there and **download + host locally** in `assets/images/`. Never hotlink from `cdn.instant.so` — if their plan lapses or assets rotate, our site breaks. Example this session: [assets/images/maple-syrup-french-toast-pour.webp](assets/images/maple-syrup-french-toast-pour.webp).
- **Unsplash is a fallback only** — when a real product/lifestyle photo exists on the legacy site, always prefer that over Unsplash. Unsplash images flag as generic stock to anyone who has seen the client's real content.
